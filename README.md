# Social Dynamics Lab - Climate Change
This quick analysis was made for a part of the Social Dynamics Lab course in collaboration with Francesca Andolfatto.

The dataset used is made up of 4.1 million URLs and online news page titles from around the world. There are 63 languages monitored by the GDELT 2015-2020 (one of the largest open databases created), and the selected articles contain the words / phrases "climate change", "global warming", "climate crisis", "greenhouse gas", "greenhouse gas" or "carbon tax". Any mention of the above terms is sufficient for the item to be included in this list.
Each annual file is made up of four columns, the first is the date on which GDELT saw the article in 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' format, the second is the language code, the third the page title and the fourth the URL.

Before starting with the elaboration it is necessary to download all the dataset in .csv format available at the above link of GDELT.

With this data elaboration it is possible to gather some insight about the number of written articles per country, the number of host per country, the pubblication rate for each host and so on with a final focus on Italy.
